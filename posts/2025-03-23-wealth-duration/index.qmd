## Introduction

Let's create a scrolly-telling story but build it within our Quarto blog. How do we go about doing that? Well, we have a few options. One way is by using the observable JS functionality in Quarto; however, I find this a bit annoying because OJS is not exactly the same as working in JS and it can get a bit confusing. Alternatively, we can just use vanilla JS and run this script inside an html chunk in our Quarto document. This .js script can also interact with our other Markdown elements, such as titles etc. See the results below!
