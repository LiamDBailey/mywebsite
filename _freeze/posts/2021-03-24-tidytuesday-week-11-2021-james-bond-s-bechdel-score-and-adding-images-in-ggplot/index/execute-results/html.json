Bailey\ndate: '2021-03-24'\ndescription: \"James Bond, the Bechdel test, and adding images to ggplot\"\ncategories: [R, Data viz, TidyTuesday]\nimage: \"featured.jpg\"\n---\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n# :older_man: Old post\n\nThis post was created before the release of R v4.1.0. Some code might be outdated.\n\n:::\n\n</br>\n\n---\n\nAnother week, another [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)! As before, this figure was created during the [CorrelAid](https://correlaid.org/) TidyTuesday meetup where we brainstorm and troubleshoot ideas. You can see the plots from all the CorrelAid TidyTuesday meetups [here](https://tidytuesday.correlaid.org/).\n\n## Introduction: The Bechdel test and James Bond\n\n---\n\nIn 1985, cartoonist [Alison Bechdel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Bechdel) published a cartoon that described 3 'rules' used to rate female representation in movies. The movie must:\n\n1. Have at least 2 named women in it.\n2. These women talk with each other.\n3. The women talk about something *other* than a man.\n\nSounds pretty simple, right? But very few films ([fewer than 50%](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/)) pass the eponymous Bechdel test, including major blockbusters like “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” and \"The Avengers\".\n\nOne film series that we would *not* expect to do particularly well on the Bechdel test is that of James Bond. Since the release of Dr. No in 1962, 007 has never been known for [his healthy relationship to women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7qn5Iw5TDM). But how do the Bond films actually compare to movies at large, and how have they changed over time?\n\n</br>\n  \n## Setup: Data and packages\n\n---\n  \nThis week's TidyTuesday included two datasets taken from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/), one complete dataset including Bechdel test scores for 8,839 movies since 1888 and a smaller subset with additional movie data from IMDB. The packages used for this post were:\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR) #To download the data\nlibrary(dplyr) #For data wrangling\nlibrary(ggplot2) #For plotting\nlibrary(fuzzyjoin) #For string matching\nlibrary(showtext) #Use fonts stored on the Google Fonts database\n\n## For adding images to our plot\nlibrary(png) #For reading .png files\nlibrary(gridExtra) #For turning .png files into grobs\nlibrary(egg) #For adding grob objects to our plot\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo start with we need to download the data and separate out the different datasets.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 11)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tDownloading file 1 of 2: `raw_bechdel.csv`\n\tDownloading file 2 of 2: `movies.csv`\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbechdel <- tuesdata$raw_bechdel\nmovies  <- tuesdata$movies\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe'll create a custom ggplot theme so we don't need to make these aesthetic changes in every plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_theme <- function(){\n  \n  theme_classic() %+replace% \n    #Remove legend by default\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n          #Make axes black\n          axis.text = element_text(colour = \"black\"),\n          #Make clear titles and caption\n          plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n          plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 1))\n  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n</br>\n  \n## Exploration: How does the data look?\n\n---\n  \nFor this visualisation, we're only really interested in the full Bechdel test dataset and don't need the more detailed movie information. Rather than treating the Bechdel test as pass/fail, each movie will be given a score from 0 (less than 2 named women) to 3 (passes the full Bechdel test). The full Bechdel test dataframe is fairly simple and should be easy to use. The `title`, `rating`, and `year` columns will be important to help us identify Bond (and non-Bond movies) and there don't appear to be any nasty surprises in the data structure!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntail(bechdel)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n   year    id imdb_id  title                    rating\n  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>    <chr>                     <dbl>\n1  2021  9473 10332588 Finding ’Ohana                3\n2  2021  9498 5144174  The Dry                       3\n3  2021  9505 10919362 Sweetheart                    3\n4  2021  9501 10813940 Ginny and Georgia             2\n5  2021  9504 5109280  Raya and the Last Dragon      3\n6  2021  9500 9286908  High Ground                   2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we want to focus on Bond movies, we need to include some external data to identify which films are in the Bond franchise. We'll consider all Bond movies except the 'spy-parody' Casino Royale from 1967. We'll use the `fuzzyjoin` package to join datasets using movie titles. Fuzzy joining will allow us to match similar titles even if they're not exactly the same (e.g. missing punctuation or different capitalisation).  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbond_movies <- read.csv(\"./data/james_bond_movies.csv\") %>% \n  #We use fuzzyjoin incase there are slight differences in the titles (e.g. missing ')\n  fuzzyjoin::stringdist_left_join(bechdel, by = c(\"movie\" = \"title\")) %>% \n  #Remove old Casino Royale and select relevant columns\n  dplyr::filter(!(movie == \"Casino Royale\" & year == \"1967\")) %>% \n  dplyr::select(movie, year, actor, bond_rating = rating) %>% \n  #Unfortunately one movie (The Living Daylights) doesn't have a Bechdel score.\n  #We still want to include this in our graph even if it doesn't have a score so we need to manually add the year\n  mutate(year = case_when(movie == \"The Living Daylights\" ~ 1987,\n                          TRUE ~ year))\n\nhead(bond_movies)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                            movie year          actor bond_rating\n1                          Dr. No 1962   Sean Connery           1\n2           From Russia with Love 1963   Sean Connery           3\n3                      Goldfinger 1964   Sean Connery           1\n4                     Thunderball 1965   Sean Connery           2\n5             You Only Live Twice 1967   Sean Connery           1\n6 On Her Majesty's Secret Service 1969 George Lazenby           2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n</br>\n  \n## Initial plots: What can we see when we start plotting?\n\n---\n  \nWe now have Bechdel scores of all (but one) of the Bond movies. To start exploring we can create a very rough plot to look at the average Bechdel score of each James Bond actor.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = bond_movies) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = actor, y = bond_rating, fill = actor),\n               colour = \"black\", width = 0.15, alpha = 0.25) +\n  #Just use viridis fill for now\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2, 3)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Bechdel score\",\n       title = \"Bechdel score of each Bond\",\n       subtitle = \"\",\n       caption = \"Data: FiveThirtyEight | Plot: @ldbailey255\") +\n  my_theme() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=648}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see there are differences in the median Bechdel score of each James Bond actor, but this initial plot is a bit lacking. Are the differences we see related to the number of movies each actor starred in? Or are we seeing a cultural shift over time as more movies pass the Bechdel test? We need to disentangle these possibilities.\n\nFirstly, we want to look at the Bechdel score of all *other* movies during the time James Bond movies were being made.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nother_movies <- bechdel %>% \n  #Remove all Bond movies\n  fuzzyjoin::stringdist_anti_join(bond_movies, by = c(\"title\" = \"movie\")) %>%\n  #Only consider movies in the years since Bond movies started\n  dplyr::filter(year >= min(bond_movies$year) & year <= max(bond_movies$year))\n\n\nrollingmean <- other_movies %>% \n  #Take a mean of Bechdel score for each year\n  dplyr::group_by(year) %>% \n  dplyr::summarise(all_movie_rating = mean(rating),\n                   n = n()) %>% \n  #Create a 3 year rolling mean\n  dplyr::mutate(lag1 = lag(all_movie_rating),\n                lead1 = lead(all_movie_rating)) %>% \n  dplyr::rowwise() %>% \n  dplyr::mutate(rollingmean_allmovies = mean(c(all_movie_rating, lag1, lead1))) %>% \n  dplyr::select(-lag1, -lead1) %>% \n  #Remove years where a rolling mean is not possible\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(rollingmean_allmovies))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe next need to define the Bond 'eras' (the periods during which each actor played James Bond).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbond_eras <- bond_movies %>% \n  group_by(actor) %>% \n  summarise(start = min(year),\n            end = max(year),\n            midyear = mean(c(start, end)),\n            mean_score = mean(bond_rating, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nbond_eras\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  actor          start   end midyear mean_score\n  <chr>          <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 Daniel Craig    2006  2015   2010.       1.5 \n2 George Lazenby  1969  1969   1969        2   \n3 Pierce Brosnan  1995  2002   1998.       2   \n4 Roger Moore     1973  1985   1979        1.43\n5 Sean Connery    1962  1971   1966.       1.5 \n6 Timothy Dalton  1987  1989   1988        2   \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nNow we can plot the mean Bechdel scores over time and compare it to the mean Bechdel score of each Bond actor!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  #Adjust the location so that movies fall in the middle of a year rather than at the start\n  geom_rect(data = bond_eras, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end + 1, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill =  actor),\n            colour = NA) +\n  geom_path(data = rollingmean, aes(x = year + 0.5, y = rollingmean_allmovies), size = 1, colour = \"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data = bond_eras, aes(x = midyear, y = mean_score), size = 3, shape = 21, fill = \"grey50\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1960, 2020, 5), name = \"\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2, 3)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Bechdel score\",\n       title = \"Bechdel score of each Bond\",\n       subtitle = \"\",\n       caption = \"Data: FiveThirtyEight | Plot: @ldbailey255\") +\n  my_theme() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</br>\n  \n## Digging deeper: Adding images\n\n---\n  \nWhile this graph serves our purposes, I don't think it's the ideal format to present the data. For one, by using year on the x-axis, we include many years where James Bond movies were not being made. Another problem we encounter is that the Bond 'eras' are not sequential, because one actor (George Lazenby) made a movie during the Sean Connery era. As an alternative, we can use the sequence of Bond movies as the x-axis. We can then compare the mean Bechdel score of each Bond to the mean Bechdel score of contemporary movies during their time in the role.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Specify the era 'order' of the actors\nbond_order <- data.frame(actor = c(\"Sean Connery\",\n                                   \"George Lazenby\",\n                                   \"Roger Moore\",\n                                   \"Timothy Dalton\",\n                                   \"Pierce Brosnan\",\n                                   \"Daniel Craig\")) %>%\n  mutate(era_nr = 1:n())\n\nbond_era_ratings <- bond_movies %>%\n  left_join(bond_order, by = \"actor\") %>% \n  arrange(era_nr, year) %>% \n  #Have a movie number that can be used as our x axis\n  tibble::rownames_to_column(var = \"movie_nr\") %>%\n  #Separate first name and surname\n  tidyr::separate(actor, into = c(\"given_name\", \"surname\"), sep = \" \") %>% \n  group_by(surname) %>% \n  summarise(mean_bond_rating = mean(bond_rating, na.rm = TRUE),\n            first_yr = first(year),\n            #The first and last number are buffered by 0.5 on either side\n            #This allows George Lazanby (with 1 movie) to still be visible\n            first_nr = as.integer(first(movie_nr)) - 0.5,\n            last_yr = last(year),\n            last_nr = as.integer(last(movie_nr)) + 0.5,\n            middle_point = mean(c(first_nr, last_nr))) %>% \n  #For each actor, determine the mean Bechdel score of all other movies during their era\n  mutate(mean_movie_rating = purrr::map2_dbl(.x = first_yr, .y = last_yr,\n                                             .f = function(first, last, movie_db){\n                                               \n                                               movie_db_subset <- other_movies %>% \n                                                 filter(year >= first & year <= last)\n                                               \n                                               mean(movie_db_subset$rating)\n                                               \n                                             }, movie_db = other_movies),\n         year_text = case_when(first_yr == last_yr ~ as.character(first_yr),\n                               TRUE ~ paste(first_yr, last_yr, sep = \"-\")))\n\n#Although we use movie number as our x axis, we want the labels to be the movie names\n#and the movie's Bechdel score\nx_labels <- bond_movies %>%\n  left_join(bond_order, by = \"actor\") %>% \n  arrange(era_nr, year) %>% \n  tibble::rownames_to_column(var = \"movie_nr\") %>% \n  mutate(movie_nr = as.integer(movie_nr),\n         movie = paste0(movie, ' (', bond_rating, ')'))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = bond_era_ratings) +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = first_nr, xmax = last_nr, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill = surname),\n            colour = \"black\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = first_nr + 0.25, xend = last_nr - 0.25, y = mean_movie_rating, yend = mean_movie_rating), size = 1.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = middle_point, y = 2.9, label = year_text),\n            size = 5) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = middle_point, y = mean_bond_rating),\n             size = 6, shape = 21, stroke = 2, fill = \"grey50\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x = middle_point, y = mean_bond_rating - 0.1,\n                label = surname), size = 7) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = middle_point, y = mean_bond_rating - 0.2,\n                label = round(mean_bond_rating, 2)), size = 7) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = x_labels$movie_nr, labels = x_labels$movie) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1, 3), breaks = 1:3) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"grey50\", \"grey50\", \"white\", \"white\", \"white\", \"grey50\"), name = \"\") +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(name = \"\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Bechdel score\",\n       title = \"How problematic is James Bond?\",\n       subtitle = \"Bechdel test score of Bond movies compared to movies from the same period\",\n       caption = \"Data: FiveThirtyEight | Plot: @ldbailey255\") +\n  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, colour = \"black\", size = 15),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.line.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15, colour = \"black\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 20),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 25, face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 17))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=1344}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing points to show the ratings of different actors works well enough, but perhaps headshots of the different actors would be more effective.

To add additional annotation to a plot I like to again take advantage of grobs. We can make our whole plot into a grob and place it inside a new (empty) plotting environment where the annotation can be included, using the `geom_annotate` function. With this method you don't need to mess around with your plot margins, and it's particularly effective if you want to include multiple plots together or create custom legends.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Load a font from Google Fonts\nsysfonts::font_add_google(name = \"Mouse Memoirs\", family = \"Mouse\")\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Ubuntu Mono\", \"Ubuntu Mono\")\n\n#Specify that the showtext package should be used\n#for rendering text\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmain_plot <- ggplot(data = bond_era_ratings_png) +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = first_nr, xmax = last_nr, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill = surname),\n            colour = NA, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = first_nr + 0.25, xend = last_nr - 0.25, y = mean_movie_rating, yend = mean_movie_rating), size = 0.75) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = middle_point, y = 2.9, label = year_text),\n            family = \"Mouse\", size = 7.5/.pt) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = middle_point, y = mean_bond_rating - 0.155,\n                label = surname), family = \"Mouse\", colour = \"#D53129\", size = 7.5/.pt) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = middle_point, y = mean_bond_rating - 0.23,\n                label = format(round(mean_bond_rating, 2), nsmall = 2)), family = \"Mouse\",\n            size = 7.5/.pt) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = middle_point, y = mean_movie_rating + 0.05,\n                label = format(round(mean_movie_rating, 2), nsmall = 2)), family = \"Mouse\",\n            size = 7.5/.pt) +\n  egg::geom_custom(aes(x = middle_point, y = mean_bond_rating, data = grob), grob_fun = \"identity\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, NA), breaks = x_labels$movie_nr, labels = x_labels$movie) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1, 3), breaks = 1:3) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"grey50\", \"grey50\", \"white\", \"white\", \"white\", \"grey50\"), name = \"\") +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(name = \"\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"<- Worse                       Bechdel score                       Better ->\",\n       title = \"How problematic is James Bond?\",\n       subtitle = \"Bechdel test score of Bond movies compared to movies from the same period\") +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 7, expand = FALSE) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, size = 7.5,\n                                   family = \"Mouse\", colour = \"black\"),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(family = \"Mouse\", colour = \"black\", size = 7.5),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.line.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title = element_text(family = \"Mouse\", size = 20),\n        plot.title = element_text(family = \"Mouse\", size = 25, margin = margin(b = 3.75)),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 7.5, margin = margin(b = 7.5)))\n\nmain <- ggplot2::ggplotGrob(main_plot)\n\nlabels <- data.frame(x = 0.87, y = c(0.6, 0.375),\n                     text = c(\"Movies from the same period\",\n                              \"Score of Bond movies\"))\n\nggplot()+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.35, 0.65), expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  annotation_custom(grob = main, xmin = 0, xmax = 0.75, ymin = 0, ymax = 1) +\n  geom_curve(aes(x = 0.825, xend = 0.7, y = 0.6, yend = 0.55), curvature = 0.2,\n             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, \"inches\")), size = 1) +\n  geom_curve(aes(x = 0.825, xend = 0.7, y = 0.375, yend = 0.45), curvature = -0.2,\n             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, \"inches\")), size = 1) +\n  geom_label(data = labels, aes(x = x, y = y, label = text),\n                        family = \"Mouse\", colour = '#D53129', size = 7.5/.pt) +\n  labs(caption = \"Data: FiveThirtyEight | Plot: @ldbailey255\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(family = \"Ubuntu Mono\", size = 5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</br>\n\n## Conclusion:\n\n---\n\nThe mean Bechdel score of movies has increased steadily since the first Bond movie was released in 1962, but Bond movies haven't kept up! James Bond films have never been known for their realistic portrayal of female characters, but it seems that the newest Bond movies with Daniel Craig are particularly bad at passing the Bechdel test when compared to their contemporaries.\n\nOf course, the Bechdel test has been rightly criticised as a very simple method for assessing female representation and ignores other issues, such as the role of the female characters in the film, the amount of [dialogue given to women](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/), and the representation of women of colour. There are now a [plethora of new tests](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/) that seek to provide a better assessment of the role of women both in front of and behind the camera. Even so, it's striking that all but one of Daniel Craig's films as James Bond fails to even include dialogue between two female characters! Will the upcoming *No Time To Die* be any better? Will a new James Bond actor herald a change to the franchise's Bechdel scores? Or is 007 just a [bit out of date](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/times-up-for-james-bond-is-007-too-brutish-for-the-me-too-era)?\n",
